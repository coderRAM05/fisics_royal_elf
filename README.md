# **🕌 Yantra Dimension Generator: A Parametric Tool for Astronomical Heritage**

The Jantar Mantar Dimension Generator is a Python/Streamlit web application that translates the complex geometric principles of the 18th-century Indian astronomical observatories (Yantras) into precise, scalable architectural blueprints.

This tool solves the challenge of adapting the fixed geometry of the Yantras by generating all required angles and dimensions based on a user-defined Latitude ($\phi$) and Scale Factor ($R$).


### **🚀 Live Application**

The application is deployed and available for public use here:
https://fisicsroyalelf.streamlit.app/


### **🔬 Project Context & Academic Contributions**

This project contributes to SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 11 (Cultural Heritage) by providing a verifiable, engineering-grade tool for:

1] Conservation: Generating accurate digital documentation for the structural analysis and maintenance of the existing historical observatories.

2] Education: Creating blueprints for building functional, scaled-down replica instruments globally.

3] Positional Astronomy: Serving as an interactive laboratory for studying the relationship between geography and celestial coordinates.


### **🛠️ Installation and Local Run**
To run the application locally, you must have Python (3.8+) installed.
